# Seaborn Plotting Methods for Data Visualization
This Project aims to different plotting methods using seaborn for data Visualization.
This project demonstrates various data visualization techniques using the Seaborn library in Python. Seaborn is a powerful statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib, making it easier to create attractive and informative visualizations.

The project includes examples of different types of plots used for data exploration, feature relationships, distributions, and more.

## Plotting Methods Covered
1. Bar Plot
2. Violin Plot
3. Scatter Plot
4. Line Plot
5. Cluster Plot
6. Pair Plot
7. Heatmap
8. Jointplot
